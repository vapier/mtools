.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

.SH Description
.iX "p mren"
.iX "c Renaming files (mren)"
.iX "c Moving files (mren)"
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmren\fR command is used to rename or move an existing MS-DOS
file or subdirectory. Its syntax is:
.PP
.(l I
\&\fR\&\f(CWmren\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-voOsSrRA\fR] \fIsourcefile\fR \fItargetfile\fR
.)l
 
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMren\fR
renames an existing file on an MS-DOS filesystem.
.PP
In verbose mode, \fR\&\f(CWMren\fR displays the new filename if the name
supplied is invalid.
.PP
If the first syntax is used (only one sourcefile), and if the target
name doesn't contain any slashes or colons, the file (or subdirectory)
is renamed in the same directory, instead of being moved to the current
\&\fR\&\f(CWmcd\fR directory as would be the case with \fR\&\f(CWmmove\fR. Unlike the
MS-DOS version of \fR\&\f(CWREN\fR, \fR\&\f(CWmren\fR can be used to rename
directories.
