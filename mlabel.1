.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

.SH Description
.iX "p mlabel"
.iX "c Labeling a disk"
.iX "c Disk label"
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmlabel\fR command adds a volume label to a disk. Its syntax is:
.(l I
\&\fR\&\f(CWmlabel\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-vcs\fR] \fIdrive\fR:[\fInew_label\fR]
.)l
 
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMlabel\fR displays the current volume label, if present. If
\&\fInew_label\fR is not given, and if neither the \fR\&\f(CWc\fR nor the
\&\fR\&\f(CWs\fR options are set, it prompts the user for a new volume label.
To delete an existing volume label, press return at the prompt.
.PP
Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MS-DOS volume label.  If an
invalid label is specified, \fR\&\f(CWmlabel\fR changes the label (and
displays the new label if the verbose mode is set). \fR\&\f(CWMlabel\fR
returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.
.PP
Mlabel supports the following options:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWc\fR\ 
Clears an existing label, without prompting the user
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWs\fR\ 
Shows the existing label, without prompting the user.
