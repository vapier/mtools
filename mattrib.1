.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

\&\fR\&\f(CWMattrib\fR is used to change MS-DOS file attribute flags. It has the
following syntax:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmattrib\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-a|+a\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-h|+h\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-r|+r\fR]
[\fR\&\f(CW-s|+s\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-/\fR]  [\fR\&\f(CW-X\fR] \fImsdosfile\fR [ \fImsdosfiles\fR \&... ]
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMattrib\fR adds attribute flags to an MS-DOS file (with the
`\fR\&\f(CW+\fR' operator) or remove attribute flags (with the `\fR\&\f(CW-\fR'
operator).
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMattrib\fR supports the following attribute bits:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWa\fR\ 
Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indicate a new file.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWr\fR\ 
Read-only bit.  Used to indicate a read-only file.  Files with this bit
set cannot be erased by \fR\&\f(CWDEL\fR nor modified.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWs\fR\ 
System bit.  Used by MS-DOS to indicate a operating system file.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWh\fR\ 
Hidden bit.  Used to make files hidden from \fR\&\f(CWDIR\fR.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMattrib\fR supports the following command line flags:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW/\fR\ 
Recursive.  Recursively list the attributes of the files in the subdirectories.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWX\fR\ 
Concise. Prints the attributes whithout any whitespace padding.  This is 
convenient for script.  If neither the "/" option is given, nor the
\&\fImsdosfile\fR contains a wildcard, and there is only one Msdos file
parameter on the command line, only the attribute is printed, and not
the filename.
This option is convenient for scripts
