.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmbadblocks\fR command is used to scan an MS-DOS floppy and mark
its unused bad blocks as bad. It uses the following syntax:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmbadblocks\fR \fIdrive\fR\fR\&\f(CW:\fR
.iX "p mbadblocks"
.iX "c Marking blocks as bad"
.iX "c Bad blocks"
.iX "c Read errors"
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMbadblocks\fR scans an MS-DOS floppy for bad blocks. All unused bad
blocks are marked as such in the FAT. This is intended to be used right
after \fR\&\f(CWmformat\fR.  It is not intended to salvage bad disks.
.SH Bugs
\&\fR\&\f(CWMbadblocks\fR should (but doesn't yet :-( ) also try to salvage bad
blocks which are in use by reading them repeatedly, and then mark them
bad.
